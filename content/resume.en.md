## About Me

As a **Full Stack Developer** with over 5 years of experience, I specialize in building scalable web applications from the ground up. My expertise spans both back-end and front-end technologies:

- **Back-End**: I develop robust systems using **Python**, **Django**, **Odoo**, and **FastAPI**, and work with databases like **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **Elasticsearch**, and **Redis**. I have a solid background in developing and managing **microservices architectures**.I handle asynchronous tasks using **Celery** in conjunction with **RabbitMQ** for efficient task queuing and message brokering.
- **Front-End**: On the client side, I leverage **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript** within **Nx monorepos**. My UI work is enhanced with CSS frameworks such as **Material-UI**, **Ant Design**, and **Tailwind CSS**. I manage state with **Redux** and **Zustand**, handle data with **React Query**, and ensure form validation through **Yup**, **Zod** and **React Hook Form**.
- **DevOps**: My DevOps skills include **Docker**, **Linux**, **Nginx**, and CI/CD pipelines with **GitLab** and **GitHub Actions**. I also monitor and log performance using the **ELK** stack, **Grafana**, and **Prometheus**.

In my role as a **Technical Lead**, I oversee project delivery and mentor a team of over 10 developers. I thrive in collaborative environments, ensuring projects are completed on time and to the highest standards. I am committed to continuous learning and applying innovative solutions to complex problems, making me an asset to any development team.
